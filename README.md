🚦 Traffic Volume and Congestion Prediction

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts traffic congestion patterns using machine learning. The dataset consists of traffic volume data collected from different junctions over time. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to estimate traffic volume based on various features.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle / UCI Machine Learning Repository
Features:
    DateTime: Timestamp of the recorded traffic data
    Junction: ID of the traffic junction
    Vehicles: Number of vehicles at a given timestamp
    Extracted Features: Year, Month, Day, Hour, DayOfWeek, Weekend
    
🔍 Project Workflow
1.Data Preprocessing
  - Convert DateTime to proper format
  - Extract new features (Year, Month, Day, Hour, etc.)
  - Handle missing values

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visualize traffic patterns over time
  - Analyze peak hours and weekdays vs. weekends

3.Machine Learning Model
  - Selected Random Forest Regressor for traffic volume prediction
  - Split data into training and testing sets
  - Standardized numerical features for better model performance

4.Evaluation Metrics
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

📊 Results
  - Model achieved a R² Score of X.XX, indicating good prediction accuracy.
  - Peak traffic hours were identified between X AM - Y PM.
🛠 Technologies Used
  - Python
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
  - Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)

📌 Future Improvements
  - Implement deep learning models for better accuracy.
  - Include weather conditions and road events as additional features.
  - Deploy the model as a real-time web application.
